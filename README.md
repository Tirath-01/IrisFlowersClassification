Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier

Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. In this case, we will explore how to solve the problem using two popular classifiers: the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and the Decision Tree algorithm.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier:
The KNN algorithm is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm. It works by finding the K nearest neighbors to a given data point in the feature space and assigns the majority class among those neighbors as the predicted class for the data point.
Here are the steps to perform iris flower classification using the KNN classifier:

a. Load the dataset: Start by loading the Iris dataset, which consists of samples of iris flowers along with their corresponding species labels.

b. Data preprocessing: Split the dataset into features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and target labels (iris species). You may also need to scale the features to ensure all variables are on the same scale.

c. Train-test split: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the KNN classifier, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

d. Choose K: Decide on the number of neighbors (K) to consider when making predictions. Typically, this value is determined through experimentation and cross-validation.

e. Train the KNN classifier: Fit the KNN classifier to the training data using the chosen value of K. This involves calculating the distances between the training samples and the new test samples.

f. Make predictions: Use the trained KNN classifier to predict the iris species for the test data points. The majority class among the K nearest neighbors will determine the predicted class.

g. Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the KNN classifier by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels from the testing set. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Decision Tree Classifier:
The Decision Tree algorithm is a versatile and interpretable classification algorithm. It creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences based on the features in the dataset.
Here are the steps to perform iris flower classification using the Decision Tree classifier:

a. Load the dataset: Similarly, start by loading the Iris dataset and splitting it into features and target labels.

b. Train-test split: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets, similar to the KNN approach.

c. Train the Decision Tree classifier: Fit the Decision Tree classifier to the training data. The algorithm will automatically learn a set of if-else conditions based on the features to classify the iris species.

d. Make predictions: Use the trained Decision Tree classifier to predict the iris species for the test data points by following the learned if-else conditions.

e. Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the Decision Tree classifier using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

It's important to note that both the KNN classifier and the Decision Tree classifier have hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize their performance. Techniques like cross-validation can be employed to find the best hyperparameter values.
